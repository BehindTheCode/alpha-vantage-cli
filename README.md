# alpha-vantage-cli

A command line app and Node.js api for retreiving data from Alpha Vantage.

You can use this from the command line to download stock data from Alpha Vantage to a CSV file.

You can use it from your Node.js app as a reusable code module.

Data is returned *as is* from Alpha Vantage with no modification.

Documentation and blog post coming soon.
